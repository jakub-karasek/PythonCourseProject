DB00002,Cetuximab,biotech,"Cetuximab is a recombinant chimeric human/mouse IgG1 monoclonal antibody that competitively binds to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and competitively inhibits the binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF).[A227973] EGFR is a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases found in both normal and tumour cells; it is responsible for regulating epithelial tissue development and homeostasis.[A228083] EGFR has been implicated in various types of cancer, as it is often overexpressed in malignant cells [A227973] and EGFR overexpression has been linked to more advanced disease and poor prognosis.[A227963] EGFR is often mutated in certain types of cancer and serves as a driver of tumorigenesis.[A228083] _In vitro_, cetuximab was shown to mediate anti-tumour effects in numerous cancer cell lines and human tumour xenografts.[A227963]  Approved by the FDA in February 2004 under the brand name ERBITUX, cetuximab is used for the treatment of head and neck cancer and metastatic, KRAS wild-type colorectal cancer, and metastatic colorectal cancer with a BRAF V600E mutation.[A227963,L39045] It has also been investigated in advanced colorectal cancer, EGFR-expressing non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and unresectable squamous cell skin cancer.[L31418] Cetuximab is administered via intravenous infusion and is used as monotherapy or in combination with other chemotherapies, including platinum agents, radiation therapy, [leucovorin], [fluorouracil], and [irinotecan].[L30448]",liquid,"Cetuximab indicated for the treatment of locally or regionally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck in combination with radiation therapy. It is indicated for treating a recurrent locoregional disease or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck in combination with platinum-based therapy with fluorouracil. It is indicated for recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck progressing after platinum-based therapy.[L30448]

Cetuximab is also indicated for K-Ras wild-type, EGFR-expressing, metastatic colorectal cancer as determined by an FDA-approved test in combination with FOLFIRI, a chemotherapy combination that includes [leucovorin], [fluorouracil], and [irinotecan]; in combination with irinotecan in patients who are refractory to irinotecan-based chemotherapy; or as monotherapy in patients who have failed oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based chemotherapy or who are intolerant to irinotecan.[L30448]

Additionally, cetuximab is also indicated for metastatic colorectal cancer that is BRAF V600E mutation-positive (as determined by an FDA-approved test) in combination with [encorafenib] but only after prior therapy.[L39045]

Cetuximab is not indicated for the treatment of Ras-mutant colorectal cancer or when the results of the Ras mutation tests are unknown.[L30448]","The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane glycoprotein and a type I receptor tyrosine kinase expressed on both normal and malignant cells. It has been investigated as a therapeutic target for anticancer treatment, as it is often upregulated in cancer types, including head and neck, colon, and rectal cancers.[L30448] When activated by its ligand, EGFR undergoes a conformational change and dimerization to form homodimers or heterodimers with another member of the ErbB family of receptors. Dimerization of EGFR activates the intracellular tyrosine kinase region of EGFR and promotes autophosphorylation, initiating a series of downstream signalling cascades, including cell differentiation, proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, and apoptosis. This EGFR signalling pathway is often dysregulated in cancer cells, leading to aberrant cell growth and enhanced cell survival.[L31418]  Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the EGFR on both normal and tumour cells to competitively inhibit the binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and other ligands that are produced by normal and tumour tissue epithelial cells.[A11, L30448] Upon binding to domain III of EGFR - which is the binding site for its growth factor ligands - cetuximab prevents the receptor from adopting an extended conformation and thereby inhibits EGFR activation, as well as phosphorylation and activation of receptor-associated kinases (MAPK, PI3K/Akt, Jak/Stat).[A11, A228078] Inhibition of the EGFR signalling pathway ultimately leads to inhibition of cell cycle progression, cell survival pathways, and tumour cell motility and invasion.[A227963] Cetuximab also induces cell apoptosis and decreases matrix metalloproteinase and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production.[A228078, L30448] _In vitro_, cetuximab was shown to inhibit tumour angiogenesis.[A227978] Binding of cetuximab to EGFR also results in internalization of the antibody-receptor complex, leading to an overall downregulation of EGFR expression.[A227973]  K-ras is a small G-protein downstream of EGFR that plays an important role in promoting the EGFR signalling cascade: in some malignant cells, K-ras can acquire activating mutations in exon 2 [L31418] and thus be continuously active regardless of EGFR regulation.[L30448] Since mutant Ras proteins can isolate the pathway from the effect of EGFR, K-Ras mutations can render EGFR inhibitors like cetuximab ineffective in exerting anti-tumour effects.[L30448, L31418] Cetuximab is thus only limited in its use for K-Ras wild-type, EGFR-expressing cancers.[L30448]",,P00533,"Receptor tyrosine kinase binding ligands of the EGF family and activating several signaling cascades to convert extracellular cues into appropriate cellular responses (PubMed:10805725, PubMed:27153536, PubMed:2790960, PubMed:35538033). Known ligands include EGF, TGFA/TGF-alpha, AREG, epigen/EPGN, BTC/betacellulin, epiregulin/EREG and HBEGF/heparin-binding EGF (PubMed:12297049, PubMed:15611079, PubMed:17909029, PubMed:20837704, PubMed:27153536, PubMed:2790960, PubMed:7679104, PubMed:8144591, PubMed:9419975). Ligand binding triggers receptor homo- and/or heterodimerization and autophosphorylation on key cytoplasmic residues. The phosphorylated receptor recruits adapter proteins like GRB2 which in turn activates complex downstream signaling cascades. Activates at least 4 major downstream signaling cascades including the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK, PI3 kinase-AKT, PLCgamma-PKC and STATs modules (PubMed:27153536). May also activate the NF-kappa-B signaling cascade (PubMed:11116146). Also directly phosphorylates other proteins like RGS16, activating its GTPase activity and probably coupling the EGF receptor signaling to the G protein-coupled receptor signaling (PubMed:11602604). Also phosphorylates MUC1 and increases its interaction with SRC and CTNNB1/beta-catenin (PubMed:11483589). Positively regulates cell migration via interaction with CCDC88A/GIV which retains EGFR at the cell membrane following ligand stimulation, promoting EGFR signaling which triggers cell migration (PubMed:20462955). Plays a role in enhancing learning and memory performance (By similarity). Plays a role in mammalian pain signaling (long-lasting hypersensitivity) (By similarity).","In response to EGF, translocated from the cell membrane to the nucleus via Golgi and ER (PubMed:17909029, PubMed:20674546). Endocytosed upon activation by ligand (PubMed:17182860, PubMed:17909029, PubMed:27153536, PubMed:2790960). Colocalized with GPER1 in the nucleus of estrogen agonist-induced cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) (PubMed:20551055)."
